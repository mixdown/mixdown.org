        Mixdown is a philosophy.  <strong>Stop Hacking Middleware.  Start Remixing.</strong>

        Loosely coupled plugins and modules are the core of node.js development.  Mixdown is a set of libraries that help you develop any type of application (web, cli, etc) faster and cleaner.  It can be consumed as a framework if you like or pick your components "dim-sum" style.

          <h2>Distributed configuration (if you wanna)</h2>
          <p>
            Configuration based dependency injection allows storage of your site configuration anywhere. File system, zookeeper, any NoSql, or anywhere else you can think of. (Except carrier pigeon, but they aren't real time so you probably don't care)
